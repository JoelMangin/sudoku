# Sudoku (HTML5, CSS, ES6, responsive design, jQuery)

Hello world!

Here you will find a sudoku game i designed entirely alone from scratch. [Living demo](https://joelmangin.github.io/sudoku/)

The game hierachy is defined as follow:

  * css/
  * existing_sudoku/
  * images/
  * js/
  * index.html

  Due to the fact that i used Es6, this game is not supported by Internet Explorer...
  It should be fine on the others browser though !

  The existing_sudoku folder provide a set of sudoku grid already solved (form: "12342323 etc..."). So why did i choose to implement a sudoku solver if i already have access to solved grid? Because this is fun...( Of course if we wants to optimize the game, it's way faster to display a grid already solved than calculating the solution...). I hope you will enjoy the game! :+1:
